  summary: "Revokes the OAuth grant identified by the provided grant_id. The entire grant is immediately invalidated, no futher requests may be made using its grant_id or grant_secret. A minimal revoked version of the grant is returned as confirmation. The user must perform the full OAuth flow to establish a new grant with your application if they so desire. This method is designed to allow your application to proactively disconnect from this userâ€™s Scryfall account from your side."
