  summary: "A Set object represents a group of related Magic cards. All Card objects on Scryfall belong to exactly one set.<br><br>Due to Magicâ€™s long and complicated history, Scryfall includes many un-official sets as a way to group promotional or outlier cards together. Such sets will likely have a code that begins with p or t, such as pcel or tori.<br><br>Official sets always have a three-letter set code, such as zen."
