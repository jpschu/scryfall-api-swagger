  summary: "Exchanges an OAuth code for a full OAuth grant object. The returned object will contain the grant_secret that you should use for future requests inside the Authorization header for that account. Each code expires in 5 minutes, and can only be used once. Repeated requests sent to this method with the same code will fail. Ensure that you save both the grant_id and the grant_secret you receive, as well as recording any other data in the object that your application needs to run, such as the information inside the account object."
