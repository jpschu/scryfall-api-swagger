  - name: rulings
    description: "Rulings represent Oracle rulings, Wizards of the Coast set release notes, or Scryfall notes for a particular card.If two cards have the same name, they will have the same set of rulings objects. If a card has rulings, it usually has more than one.Rulings with a scryfall source have been added by the Scryfall team, either to provide additional context for the card, or explain how the card works in an unofficial format (such as Duel Commander)."

    description: "OAuth and registered API applications are currently in private beta. Public registration for applications is not currently available.Some Scryfall API methods are restricted to valid applications, and registered applications receive increased API limits.In addition, your application can implement an OAuth workflow that allows people with Scryfall accounts to grant your application programatic access to their data."
